# Flappy Bird (2D)

> Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

This project uses Unity and C# to create my own flappy bird game with scoring.
